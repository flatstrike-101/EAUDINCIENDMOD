Karl (The Blessed) I of Austria
-----------------------------------------------
Karl I of Austria was born on August 17, 1887, to a wealthy royal family commonly known as the Habsburg’s. This same royal family united Austria as one thanks to Karl’s grandfather Archduke Karl Ludwig. After the death of Franz Ferdinand due to the Spanish flu, Karl became the next in line for the Austrian throne, then in 1916 Emperor Franz Joseph died due to pneumonia in the right lung. 

Karl I is in charge of a fallen from grace Austria, in charge of unruly Hungarians who refuse to see Austria as their rightful ruler, and is in charge of a nation that is slowly losing international respect. 

But something is in the wind and everything is appearing at just the right time in just the right place for Austria to regain its former glory. The only question is if Karl and Austria are ready to truly reclaim their place in the sun, and if Austria can hold itself together to see it through, after all, it’s only a matter of time.
