Alexander Kerensky
-----------------------------------------------
Alexander Kerensky was born on May 4, 1881 to a lower-middle class family, many people believe that him being born into this family made him a reformer, but it was really the assassination of Tsar Nicholas II in 1901 that turned him into a radical reformer. 

Kerensky spent the next 11 years gathering support in the Russian Empire against the tsar’s corrupt regime, risking prison and death, as well as gaining a seat in the Russian parliament. But due to increased anger in Tsar Michael Alexandrovsky, the people and peasants revolted in the name of a Russian republic. Many lives were lost on both sides in the Russian Civil war, and when the civil war ended in 1918, not a lot of people had confidence in Kerensky’s Russia. Kerensky and America then formed the world security pact in order to secure peace and stability in the world.

However, the tsar was exiled to a secret location that only he knows, Lenin is committed to a guerilla war in the east to undermine the current government’s administration, and the world security pact does nothing for the stability and security of the world, leading to talks about possibly dismantling the entire idea. Times are tough for Russia, and they’re just going to get tougher. Can Kerensky push through this crisis with the people behind him or will he fail Russia and leave it to the fires of revolution?
