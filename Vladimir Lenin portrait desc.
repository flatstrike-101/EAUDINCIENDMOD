Vladimir Lenin | Hero of the people
-----------------------------------------------
Vladimir Lenin was born on April 22, 1870 ironically to a moderately wealthy family. Founding the communist party in Russia in 1912, Lenin went on to inspire the peasants, the poor, and the workers. After the Russian civil war ended in 1918 to a Republican Russia, it quickly became very unstable. Lenin knew what he had to do, it was time to reform Russia in a communist direction, although socialism will do. The reforms Lenin thought of gave rising popularity to his communist party. But the Russian parliament scorned him and banned his party, making Lenin and his loyal supporters to defy the Russian republic and forge guerrilla warfare in eastern Russia.

And now Lenin is in charge of a truly united Russia, where the people shall have peace, land, and bread forever! And be free of dictatorship forever! . . . But as always, there’s always a bad egg in the pile, the only question is who they are and when they’ll execute their plans.

Russia is yours Lenin… for the time-being.

#Tbh, I find this whole thing with the CSA still being alive thing completely stupid although that's just my Yankee blood being toxic. I mean, why didn't the acting president at the time just whoop all their asses? We have the people, we have the equipment, we have the meats.
