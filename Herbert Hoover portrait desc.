Herbert Hoover
---------------------------------------------------
Herbert Hoover was born on August 10, 1874, in West Branch, Iowa, United States of America. Winning the 1928 presidential election against Al Smith, and again winning against FDR on the grounds that if he was elected for a second term he would retake Texas during his first hundred days in office. He lied. This evolved in 1935 when the rest of the south seceded in order to protect their lifestyle of slavery. 

Overall, Hoover’s political life has been extremely controversial these past years, lying to the general public. However, life in America has been swell during his administration, but remember, there’s always the calm before the storm, the only question is what will it be? Will it be an economic crash? Will it be war with the south? Or will it be the failure of the American government, leading to their total collapse?
