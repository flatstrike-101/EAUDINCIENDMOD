Otto Strasser
-----------------------------------------------
Otto Strasser was born in Windshelm, Bavaria, on September 10, 1897. Being part of the working class he joined the Social Democratic Party but soon found it disgusting to be in the same party of people that put down a workers’ uprising in the Rhur. Otto soon left and joined the NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers’ Party), where his brother, Gregor, had worked as a journalist for the party for many years previously. Otto Strasser, Joseph Goebbels, and his brother quickly rose through the ranks of the party and eventually became the leader of the party’s left faction in Germany.

Then a man who called himself Adolf Hitler joined the NSDAP and quickly asserted himself in the party ranks, believing that Otto Strasser’s ideas were too extreme for Germany and caused a divide deepening ever wider. It wasn’t uncommon for Otto and Adolf to have arguments over which way the party should lean to. These arguments got worse and worse, the whole party would yell at each other, and pretty soon it was not uncommon for the party members to attack each other. 

However, Hitler’s charisma overtook the party and Otto Strasser resigned from the party in disgrace along with numerous other people. Otto, Gregor, and Goebbels quickly formed a new party called the “Black Front” and were natural rivals with the NSDAP, Otto’s previous party. Even now party members and party cronies fight each other on streets and in dark alleys. Neither party will be satisfied until the other drops dead, figuratively and literally.
